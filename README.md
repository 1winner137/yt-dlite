python yt-dlite.py --video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example

# Download audio (default: mp3)
python yt-dlite.py --audio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example

# Specify format
python yt-dlite.py --video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example --format webm

# Resume interrupted download
python yt-dlite.py --resume --video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example

# List all available formats
python yt-dlite.py --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example

# Specify output directory
python yt-dlite.py --video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example --output /path/to/save
```

## Advanced Usage

### Format Selection

List available formats:

```bash
python yt-dlite.py --list-formats https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example
```

This will display all available formats with their IDs, extensions, and resolutions, not limited to youtube site.

### Resume Downloads

yt-dlite can continue partially downloaded files:

```bash
python yt-dlite.py --resume --video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example
```

### miscellaneous

Download playlist:

```bash
python yt-dlite.py --video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example --output ~/Downloads
```
It works like yt-dlp, so you can use --no-playlist to download a single video instead of a whole playlist
